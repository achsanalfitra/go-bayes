# Go Bayes

---

The **Go Bayes** is a project about implementing bayesian methods using the Go Language. The implementations includes basic bayesian probability computation, inference, learning, simulation, up until machine learning from scratch. Initially, this project will start as a basic CLI, that separates between the engine and the interfacing. This separation allows this project to be split into engines for people who wants the power of bayesian computation in Go or integrated to a frontend framework to create an accessible learning/calculation/simulation tool.
